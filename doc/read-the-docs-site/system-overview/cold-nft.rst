Cold NFT locking script
=======================

Cold committee credential parameters
------------------------------------

The cold NFT locking script requires a specific cold committee credential to function.
This cold committee credential gets inlined as a parameter in the code of the cold NFT locking script directly when it is compiled and initialized. 

Rules
-----

The script enforces the following rules unconditionally:

* The purpose of the script execution must be `Spending`.

* The UTXO being spent must be in the transaction's inputs (this will always be the case when the script is invoked by a properly implemented ledger layer).

The script enforces the following additional rules depending on the redeemer:

Rules for ``AuthorizeHot`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is an ``AuthorizeHot`` action:

* The transaction produces an output that is identical to the input being authorized.
* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **delegation group** defined in the datum.
* The transaction contains a hot committee credential authorization certificate. 

  * The cold credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided to the script as a parameter.
  * The hot credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided in the redeemer.

* The transaction does not contain any other certificates.

Rules for ``ResignDelegation`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``ResignDelegation`` action:

* The transaction sends an output that meets the following criteria:

  * The address matches the address of the input being authorized.
  * The value of the output is the same as the value of the input being authorized.
  * The datum is unchanged except that the resignee specified in the redeemer is removed from the **delegation group**.
  * The reference script in the output is the same if present, otherwise it is not set.

* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by the resignee.
* The resignee is a member of the **delegation group** defined by the datum.
* The resignee is not the last member of the **delegation group**, which would leave the group empty.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``ResignCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``ResignCold`` action:

* The transaction produces an output that is identical to the input being authorized.
* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the datum.
* The transaction contains a cold committee resignation certificate.

  * The cold credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided to the script as a parameter.

* The transaction does not contain any other certificates.

Rules for ``RotateCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``RotateCold`` action:

* The transaction sends an output that meets the following criteria:

  * The address matches the address of the input being authorized.
  * The value of the output is the same as the value of the input being authorized.
  * The **certificate authority** is the same in the output datum as it is in the input datum.
  * The **membership group** in the output datum is not empty.
  * The **delegation group** in the output datum is not empty.
  * The output does not contain a reference script.

* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the input datum.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``UnlockCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is an ``UnlockCold`` action:

* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the input datum.

Q&A about ``UnlockCold``
------------------------

Question
~~~~~~~~

If the membership group can spend the NFT without restriction, why is it necessary to include more specific actions such as ``RotateCold`` or ``ResignCold``? 

Answer
~~~~~~

The unlock action is very dangerous, as it does not check anything beyond that the transaction is signed. 
If a transaction does something unintended with the NFT while unlocking it, it could render the cold credential unusable or worse --- give that control to someone else. 
The more restrictive actions are available to cover known use cases and to provide additional safety guarantees not provided by the unlock action.

Question
~~~~~~~~

Why is the unlock action available if it is so dangerous? 

Answer
~~~~~~

Not including the unlock action is also dangerous. 
Consider what would happen if a security flaw was found in the cold NFT locking script.
If the unlock action wasn't available, there would be no way to send the NFT to a patched version of the script, because all other actions require the NFT to be sent back to the address from which it originated. 
The only way to prevent the security flaw from being exploited would be to resign from the committee, which is irrecoverable without an election, a process beyond the ability of the committee member to control.

.. warning::
   As mentioned before, the **membership group** has full control over the cold NFT, and consequently the cold credential itself. 

   Refer to the warning in :ref:`system_overview` for guidelines on mitigating this risk.
