Cold NFT locking script
=======================

NFT asset class parameter
-------------------------

The cold NFT locking script requires a specific NFT asset class to function.
This asset class gets inlined as a parameter into the code of the script directly when it is compiled and initialized. 

Cold committee credential parameters
------------------------------------

The cold NFT locking script requires a specific cold committee credential to function.
This cold committee credential gets inlined as a parameter in the code of the cold NFT locking script directly when it is compiled and initialized. 

Rules
-----

The script enforces the following rules unconditionally:

* The purpose of the script execution must be `Spending`.
* The UTXO being spent must be in the transaction's inputs (this will always be the case when the script is invoked by a properly implemented ledger layer).
* The UTXO being spent should contain inline datum.

The script enforces the following additional rules depending on the redeemer:

Rules for ``AuthorizeHot`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is an ``AuthorizeHot`` action:

* The transaction produces an output that is identical to the input being authorized.
* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **delegation group** defined in the datum.
* The transaction contains a hot committee credential authorization certificate. 

  * The cold credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided to the script as a parameter.
  * The hot credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided in the redeemer.

* The transaction does not contain any other certificates.

Rules for ``ResignMembership`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``ResignMembership`` action:

* The transaction sends an output that meets the following criteria:

  * The address matches the address of the input being authorized.
  * The value of the output is the same as the value of the input being authorized.
  * The datum is unchanged except that the resignee specified in the redeemer is removed from the **membership group**.
  * The reference script in the output is the same if present, otherwise it is not set.

* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by the resignee.
* The resignee is a member of the **membership group** defined by the datum.
* The resignee is not the last member of the **membership group**, which would leave the group empty.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``ResignDelegation`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``ResignDelegation`` action:

* The transaction sends an output that meets the following criteria:

  * The address matches the address of the input being authorized.
  * The value of the output is the same as the value of the input being authorized.
  * The datum is unchanged except that the resignee specified in the redeemer is removed from the **delegation group**.
  * The reference script in the output is the same if present, otherwise it is not set.

* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by the resignee.
* The resignee is a member of the **delegation group** defined by the datum.
* The resignee is not the last member of the **delegation group**, which would leave the group empty.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``ResignCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``ResignCold`` action:

* The transaction produces an output that is identical to the input being authorized.
* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the datum.
* The transaction contains a cold committee resignation certificate.

  * The cold credential contained in the certificate is the same credential provided to the script as a parameter.

* The transaction does not contain any other certificates.

Rules for ``RotateCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is a ``RotateCold`` action:

* The transaction sends an output that meets the following criteria:

  * The address matches the address of the input being authorized.
  * The value of the output is the same as the value of the input being authorized.
  * The **certificate authority** is the same in the output datum as it is in the input datum.
  * The **membership group** in the output datum is not empty.
  * The **delegation group** in the output datum is not empty.
  * The output does not contain a reference script.

* The transaction does not send any other outputs to an address with the script's own payment credential.
* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the input datum.
* The transaction has been signed by all members of the **membership group** in the output datum that are not in the input datum.
* The transaction has been signed by all members of the **delegation group** in the output datum that are not in the input datum.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``BurnCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is an ``BurnCold`` action:

* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the input datum.
* All outputs from the transaction do not contain the cold NFT.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

Rules for ``UpgradeCold`` actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the redeemer is an ``UpgradeCold`` action:

* The transaction has been signed by a majority of users from the **membership group** defined in the input datum.
* The transaction includes an input at current script address that holds 1 cold NFT.
* The destination script hash is different than the current script hash.
* 1 cold NFT is sent to the upgrade destination script.
* The transaction does not contain any certificates.

.. warning::
    Before updating the cold script, it's critical to upgrade the hot locking script, especially if the cold datum structure changes. Upgrading out of order could lock the hot NFT script, as it relies heavily on the cold datum structure, including within its `UpgradeHot` function.

   The **membership group** has full control over the cold NFT, and consequently the cold credential itself. 
   **membership group** members should safeguard their keys as if they were keys for the cold credential itself.
