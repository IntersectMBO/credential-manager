Cardano credential management system
------------------------------------

The Cardano Credential Manager system uses two types of credentials for committee members: the cold credential, which is a primary identifier used sparingly for critical authorizations, and the hot credential, which is used frequently for routine committee operations and voting. 

While public key credentials are easy to create and cost-effective, script credentials offer more sophisticated security features but are more complex and expensive to operate.
