Usage
=====

The usage of the command is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   cc-sign --help

   Usage: cc-sign [-v|--version] [-q|--quiet] [-y|--yes]
                  (-k|--private-key-file FILEPATH) 
                  ((-t|--tx-body-file FILEPATH) | --tx-bundle-file FILEPATH)
                  (-o|--out-file FILEPATH)

   CLI application for signing CC Credential Manager transactions.

   Available options:
   -h,--help                Show this help text
   -v,--version             Show version.
   -q,--quiet               Do not print summary output (implies -y)
   -y,--yes                 Automatically confirm all prompts
   -k,--private-key-file FILEPATH
                              The PEM file containing your encrypted private key
   -t,--tx-body-file FILEPATH
                              The file containing the transaction body to sign.
   --tx-bundle-file FILEPATH
                              The file containing the transaction bundle to sign.
   -o,--out-file FILEPATH   A file path to save the transaction witness or
                              witness bundle file.


There are three required options that must always be provided:

- ``--private-key-file``: This is the filepath of your private key file which you will use to sign the transaction.
- ``--tx-body-file`` or ``--tx-bundle-file``: This is the filepath of the transaction body or transaction bundle file which you will sign.
  Use ``--tx-body-file`` to sign a JSON tx body text envelope file, use ``--tx-bundle-file`` to sign a binary tx bundle file.
- ``--out-file``: This is the filepath where the resulting witness file will be saved.

The command will first prompt you for the pass phrase you used to encrypt the private key file.
Enter it to decrypt the private key.
Then it will print out a series of summary items and ask you to confirm the details for each.
To confirm, type the character ``y`` and hit enter / return.
Typing anything else or just hitting enter / return will abort the signing.
Here is an example output:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cc-sign \
      --tx-bundle-file ~/Downloads/vote-info-demo.txbundle \
      --private-key-file ~/private-keys/bob-voter.private \
      --out-file ~/Desktop/vote-info-demo.bob.witbundle

   Enter pass phrase for example-certificates/children/child-4/child-4.private:
